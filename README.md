**1. Variance Threshold**

          In this step we will be removing the features which have constant features which are actually not important for solving the problem statement.

**2.Correlation**


**3. Mutual Gain**

          
**4. Chi-Square**

         
**5.Feature Selection Technique from ML 

          Sklearn - Select From Model()
